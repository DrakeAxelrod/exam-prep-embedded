# Key Points

## Lecture 1

- Quality attributes describe desired properties of the system under development.
- Dependability, scalability, performance, availability, security, maintainability, testability, ...
- Developers must prioritize quality attributes and design a system that meets chosen thresholds.
- Quality is often subjective. Choose a definition, and offer objective thresholds.
- Software should be dependable and useful before it is released into the world.
- Verification is the process of demonstrating that an implementation meets its specification.
- This is the primary means of making software dependable (and demonstrating dependability).
- Testing is most common form of verification.

## Lecture 2

- Dependability is one of the most important software characteristics.
- Aim for correctness, reliability, safety, robustness.
- Often assessed using reliability.
- Reliability depends on the pattern of usage of the software. Different users will interact differently.
- Reliability measured using ROCOF, POFOD, Availability, MTBF
- Availability is the ability of the system to be available for use, especially after a failure.
- Performance is about management of resources in the face of demand to achieve acceptable timing.
- Usually measured in terms of throughput and latency.
- Scalability is the ability to “grow” the system to process an increasing number of requests.
- While still meeting performance requirements.
- Security is the ability to protect data and information from unauthorized access...
- ... while still providing access to people and systems that are authorized.
- Security is not “measured”, but requires defining attacks and actions to prevent or reduce impact of risk, then assessing those actions.
